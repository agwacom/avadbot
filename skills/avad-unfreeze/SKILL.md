# /avad-unfreeze — Clear Freeze Boundary

Remove the edit restriction set by `/avad-freeze`, allowing edits to all directories.

## Clear the boundary

```bash
STATE_DIR="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA:-$HOME/.avadbot}"
if [ -f "$STATE_DIR/freeze-dir.txt" ]; then
  PREV=$(cat "$STATE_DIR/freeze-dir.txt")
  rm -f "$STATE_DIR/freeze-dir.txt"
  echo "Freeze boundary cleared (was: $PREV). Edits are now allowed everywhere."
else
  echo "No freeze boundary was set."
fi
```

Tell the user the result. Note that `/avad-freeze` hooks are still registered for the
session — they will just allow everything since no state file exists. To re-freeze,
run `/avad-freeze` again.
